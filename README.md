# <span style="font-family: Arial;">Lung Cancer Prediction</span>

<span style="font-size: 18px;">This project aims to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on user input and a pre-trained machine learning model. The model is trained using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm on a dataset of survey responses related to lung cancer.</span>

## <span style="font-family: Arial;">Requirements</span>

- <span style="font-family: Arial;">Python 3.6 or higher</span>
- <span style="font-family: Arial;">Required Python packages can be installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`</span>

## <span style="font-family: Arial;">Usage</span>

1. <span style="font-family: Arial;">Clone the repository:</span>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shoaib315/lung-cancer-prediction.git
```
2. <span style="font-family: Arial;">Navigate to the project directory:</span>

```bash
cd lung-cancer-prediction
```
3. <span style="font-family: Arial;">Install the required packages:</span>

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4.<span style="font-family: Arial;">Run the prediction script:</span>

```bash
code.py
```

## DATASET

<span style="font-family: Arial;">The dataset used for training the model is stored in the survey_lung_cancer.csv file. It contains survey responses related to lung cancer, including factors such as gender, age, and various symptoms. The dataset has been preprocessed to convert categorical variables into numerical representations.</span>

## MODEL
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The lung cancer prediction model is trained using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The features are standardized using the StandardScaler from scikit-learn to ensure consistent scaling between training and prediction.</span>

## CONTRIBUTING
